    "cleave": "When you cleave armored foes at close range, mark exhaustion and roll with Might. On a hit, you smash through their defenses and equipment; inflict 3-wear. On a 7–9, you overextend your weapon or yourself: mark wear or end up in a bad spot, your choice",
    "confuse senses": " When you throw something to confuse an opponent’s senses at close or intimate range, roll with Finesse. On a hit, you’ve thrown them off balance, blinded them, deafened them, or confused them, and given yourself an opportunity. On a 10+, they have to take some time to get their bearings and restore their senses before they can act clearly again. On a 7–9, you have just a few moments.",
    "disarm": "When you target an opponent’s weapon with your strikes at close range, roll with Finesse. On a hit, they have to mark 2-exhaustion or lose their weapon—it’s well out of reach. On a 10+, they have to mark 3-exhaustion instead of 2.",
    "harry a group": "When you harry a group of enemies at far range, mark wear and roll with Cunning. On a 10+, both. On a 7–9, choose 1. • inflict 2-morale harm • they are pinned or blocked",
    "improvise weapon": "When you make a weapon out of improvised materials around you, roll with Cunning. On a hit, you make a weapon; the GM will tell you its range tag and at least one other beneficial tag based on the materials you used. On a 7–9, the weapon also has a weakness tag.",
    "parry": "When you try to parry the attacks of an enemy at close range, mark exhaustion and roll with Finesse. On a hit, you consume their attention. On a 10+, all 3. On a 7–9, pick 1. • you inflict morale or exhaustion (GM’s choice) • you disarm your opponent; their weapon is out of hand, but in reach • you don’t suffer any harm",
    "quick shot": "When you fire a snap shot at an enemy at close range, roll with Luck. On a hit, inflict injury. On a 7–9, choose 1. On a 10+, choose 2. • you don’t mark wear • you don’t mark exhaustion • you move quickly and change your position (and, if you choose, range) • you keep your target at bay—they don’t move",
    "storm a group": "When you storm a group of foes in melee, mark exhaustion and roll with Might. On a hit, trade harm. On a 10+, choose 2. On a 7–9, choose 1. • you show them up; you inflict 2-morale harm • you keep them off balance and confused; you inflict 2-exhaustion • you avoid their blows to the best of your ability; you suffer little (-1) harm. • you use them against each other; mark exhaustion again and they inflict their harm against themselves",
    "trick shot": "When you fire a clever shot designed to take advantage of the environment at any range, mark wear and roll with Finesse. On a 7–9, choose 2. On a 10+, choose 3. • your shot lands in any target of your choice within range, even if it’s behind cover or hidden (inflicting injury or wear if appropriate) • your shot strikes a second available target of your choice • your shot cuts something, breaks something, or knocks something over, your choice • your shot distracts an opponent and provides an opportunity",
    "vicious strike": "When you viciously strike an opponent where they are weak at intimate or close range, mark exhaustion and roll with Might. On a hit, they suffer serious (+1) harm and cannot mark wear on their armor to block it. On a 10+, you get away with the strike. On a 7–9, they score a blow against you as well"
